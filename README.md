# Flexbox Grid

A Set of React Native Components to make a grid easier to reason about. I aim to have it match closely to react bootstraps grid api for familiarity.

# The Problem
Responsive Design is easy on the web but a bit harder on a mobile app.

I'm experimenting with using a CSS type grid to have conditional looks based on device width similar to media queries.

# What's working
* Basic Grid
* Styles
* Use Flex on items
* Hiding Items

# To Do
* Come up with more layouts
* Horizontal Display(Not sure if needed/wanted)
